# MAX Engine

The MAX Engine is the core execution module for the MAX system.  
It processes input, returns structured output, and provides a stable foundation for higher‑level runtime options.

## Purpose
- Provide a minimal, reliable execution function.
- Serve as the base layer for Options B, C, and D.
- Keep the system stable during early phases.

## Function
The engine exposes a single function:



runMAX(input)


This function:
- accepts any input
- returns a structured response
- includes a timestamp for traceability

## Status
This is the Phase 2 engine.  
Additional capabilities will be added in later phases.
